            <h3>Happy</h3>
            <p>“I love seeing you happy even if it’s through a screen or a text. Your joy lifts me, even from far away. Like that time you called me your chalant boyfriend or when we joked in our courtroom roleplay — it reminds me how blessed I am to love someone so rare. Your happiness means everything to me, Anaïs. Keep smiling, my love. I’m always cheering for you.”</p>

            <p>“Breathe, baby. I know the pressure of expectations, and life can be a lot, especially now that we’re apart. But you’ve always been strong. Remember how you still held everything together during IB even when it was overwhelming? That strength is still in you. I’m not there to hold your hand physically, but spiritually, I’m right beside you, praying for you.”</p>

            <p>“I know you’re tired mentally, emotionally, maybe even spiritually. I wish I could be there to rub your back or just hold you quietly. But even across the miles, know this: you’re not alone. Sleep peacefully knowing someone out here is thinking of you with love so deep, only God can fully understand it.”</p>

            <p>“I know it sucks to go through this every month without someone there to comfort you. But I’m sending my love, warmth, and the biggest virtual cuddle right now. Rest, hydrate, and treat yourself like the queen you are. If I were there, I’d buy you snacks, wrap you in a blanket, and kiss your hand gently. You’re strong, even on the hard days.”</p>

            <p>“I know the distance can make us question things, but baby, let me remind you: it’s still you. It has always been you. Your voice, your laugh, your peace, your fire, I don’t want anyone else. This space between us? Just a test. But our love is built to last. You’re not too much, you’re everything I’ve been praying for.”</p>

            <h3>Feeling Freaky</h3>
            <p>“Let’s not lie… distance doesn’t make the feelings fade 😏. I still remember our kisses, the way you let me hold you close, bite your hand, whisper things in your ear, and go to places 😏. I’ve been patient, and I’ll keep being patient, but just know that when we finally reunite, I’ll love you in every way you’ve dreamed of. Gently. Passionately. Completely. Till then… keep teasing me with those eyes on video call 😅.”</p>

            <p>“If I could, I’d be there making you soup, holding your hand, and watching something comforting with you. But since I can't, please know I’m praying for your healing and comfort. Rest well, drink lots of water, and let yourself be taken care of — even from afar. I love you, sick or healthy.”</p>

            <p>“I miss you too, baby — every single day. Your voice, your eyes, your little expressions. But missing each other means we have something so real, so worth it. It won’t be forever. One day, we’ll laugh at how hard it used to be. Till then, close your eyes and remember every sweet moment. I’m holding you in my heart.”</p>

I’m learning, growing, and I’ll keep doing better — because you deserve love that listens, apologizes, and changes. I’m here, when you're ready.”</p>
